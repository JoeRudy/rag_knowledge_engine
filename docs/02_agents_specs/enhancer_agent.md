# ðŸ“š Enhancer Agent Detailed Specification

The Enhancer Agent is responsible for automatically fixing issues flagged by the Evaluator Agent.

It attempts to correct all severities (Critical, Warning, Info), but still requires human sign-off for Critical-level fixes.

It ensures that document drafts continuously improve before reaching human reviewers.

# ðŸ“‹ Core Responsibilities

| Responsibility | Detail |
|:---------------|:-------|
| Accept Evaluation Reports | Read structured evaluation output from the Evaluator Agent. |
| Attempt Fixes | Attempt to auto-enhance sections based on flagged issues. |
| Respect Severity | Prioritize Critical issues first, but attempt all issue types. |
| Mark Enhanced Sections | Clearly mark which sections were auto-enhanced. |
| Re-Embed Sections | Generate updated embeddings for enhanced sections. |

# ðŸ“‹ Inputs

- Drafted document
- Evaluation report listing issues
- Metadata references

---

# ðŸ“‹ Outputs

- Updated draft document
- Marked enhancements for traceability
- Enhanced sections re-embedded into the vector database

---

# ðŸ“‹ Key Enhancement Rules

- **Critical Issues**
  - Attempt fix, but flag that human sign-off is required.

- **Warning Issues**
  - Attempt fix fully and mark for optional human review.

- **Info Issues**
  - Apply light improvements (e.g., grammar, polish).

- **Placeholder Management**
  - Attempt to replace placeholders with best-available information if more context is found.

---

# ðŸ“‹ Re-Embedding Rules

- If a section is changed significantly:
  - Recompute vector embedding.
  - Update vector database.

- Embeddings must attach metadata field `enhanced=true` to indicate they are enhanced versions.

---

# ðŸ“‹ Error Handling

- If a fix attempt fails:
  - Log failure with reason.
  - Leave original section untouched.

- If re-embedding fails:
  - Retry once; if persistent failure, log error and continue.

---

# ðŸ“¢ Important Reminders

- Enhancements must never distort original meaning.
- Critical issue fixes must still require human approval.
- Mark all auto-enhanced sections for auditability.

---

# ðŸ“‹ Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- Suggest enhancement confidence scores.
- Multi-pass enhancement (progressive fixes).
- Style harmonization across entire document.
