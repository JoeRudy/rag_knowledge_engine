# ðŸ“š Human Review Layer Detailed Specification

The Human Review Layer provides an optional but critical manual checkpoint in the RAG Knowledge Engine's document lifecycle.

It enables human engineers or reviewers to approve, request enhancements, or reject AI-drafted documents.

# ðŸ“‹ Core Responsibilities

| Responsibility | Detail |
|:---------------|:-------|
| Receive Documents | Accept finalized documents from the Evaluator or Enhancer Agents. |
| Present Issues | Display any Critical, Warning, or Info issues flagged by Evaluator. |
| Support Reviewer Actions | Approve, Request Enhancement, or Reject drafts. |
| Enforce Critical Sign-Off | Require manual human approval for Critical issues, even if auto-fixed. |
| Track Decisions | Record reviewer actions and timestamps. |
| Finalize Document Status | Transition documents to "Final" or "Needs Enhancement" based on review outcomes. |

# ðŸ“‹ Inputs

- Enhanced document
- Evaluation report summary
- Metadata references

---

# ðŸ“‹ Outputs

- Reviewer decision:
  - Approve
  - Request Enhancement
  - Reject
- Updated document state
- Reviewer comments (optional)

---

# ðŸ“‹ Key Behaviors

- **Critical Issues Cannot Auto-Approve**:
  - Even if an Enhancer Agent "fixes" Critical issues, a human must still approve.

- **Reviewer Options**:
  - **Approve** âž” Document moves to Final Storage.
  - **Request Enhancement** âž” Document sent back to Enhancer Agent.
  - **Reject** âž” Document sent back to Author Agent for major rewrite.

- **Optional Sampling**:
  - Allow human spot checks even if no Critical issues exist.

---

# ðŸ“‹ Decision Tracking

- Reviewer username or ID
- Decision timestamp
- Decision type (Approve, Request Enhancement, Reject)
- Optional reviewer comments

---

# ðŸ“‹ Error Handling

- If reviewer decision is missing after timeout:
  - Auto-flag for escalation.

- If document metadata is missing:
  - Reject document and request reprocessing.

---

# ðŸ“¢ Important Reminders

- The Human Review Layer is mandatory for production-grade documentation.
- Critical issues must *always* pass through a human, no exceptions.
- Reviewer comments help improve future auto-enhancement logic.

---

# ðŸ“‹ Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- Reviewer dashboard with issue summaries.
- Human-in-the-loop learning: AI adjusts based on human corrections.
- Reviewer workload distribution system.
