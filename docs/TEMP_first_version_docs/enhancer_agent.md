# Component Deep Dive - Enhancer Agent

## Component Name
Enhancer Agent

## Primary Responsibility
Attempt to automatically fix or enhance flagged issues in drafted documents based on evaluation reports, while maintaining full traceability and ensuring re-embedding of improved content.

## Inputs
- Structured evaluation reports from the Evaluator Agent
- Drafted documents with flagged issues

## Outputs
- Enhanced documents with issues corrected or improved
- Updated embeddings for enhanced sections
- Traceable markers indicating enhanced sections, timestamps, and agent ID

## Subcomponents/Modules
- **Issue Resolver**: Attempts to fix Critical, Warning, and Info severity issues
- **Enhancement Logger**: Records each enhancement action, timestamp, and agent responsible
- **Re-Embedder**: Automatically re-embeds improved sections to update the vector database
- **Critical Issue Sign-Off Flagger**: Marks Critical issues even if fixed for mandatory human validation

## Dependencies
- Evaluator Agent outputs (structured evaluation reports)
- Embedding Service (for re-embedding enhanced sections)
- Vector database (Pinecone) for updated embedding storage

## Special Behavior
- **Fix All Severities**: Attempts to resolve Critical, Warning, and Info issues automatically
- **Mandatory Human Review for Critical Issues**: Even fixed Critical issues require final human validation
- **Automatic Re-Embedding**: All enhanced sections are re-embedded to maintain accurate semantic search
- **Traceability Marking**: Auto-enhanced sections are marked with hidden metadata containing timestamp and agent ID

## Future Enhancements
- Adaptive rephrasing styles (technical tone, executive tone, etc.)
- Advanced context expansion for weak sections (deep enrichment based on additional retrieved content)
- Smart enhancement retry logic if fixes initially fail
- Human-in-the-loop real-time enhancement suggestions
