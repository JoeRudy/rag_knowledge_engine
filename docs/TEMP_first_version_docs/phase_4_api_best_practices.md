# Phase 4: API Best Practices and Standards

This document defines the **official internal API best practices** for all agents and services within the RAG Knowledge Engine.

✅ These practices ensure:
- Professional-grade consistency
- Predictable behavior across services
- Easier future evolution and maintenance

---

# 📚 Overview

Building consistent APIs across services is critical for:
- Reliable agent orchestration
- Clear expectations for input/output
- Seamless integration of future components
- High maintainability and scalability

All microservices must follow these API best practices.

# 📋 General API Design Rules

| Rule | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| Use REST principles | All service communication is over HTTP POST endpoints |
| All endpoints versioned under `/v1/` | Future-proofing for non-breaking upgrades |
| Consistent resource naming | Snake_case for fields, lowercase paths |
| Status fields mandatory in responses | Must be either `"success"` or `"error"` |
| Human-readable `message` always included | For easy client-side debugging |

---

# 📦 Request Guidelines

| Rule | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| All request payloads must be JSON | No form-data or XML allowed |
| Required fields clearly enforced | Use validation layers where possible |
| Optional fields explicitly documented | Avoid hidden optional behaviors |
| Consistent casing | All keys in snake_case |

---

# 📤 Response Guidelines

| Rule | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| Top-level `status` field mandatory | "success" or "error" |
| Top-level `message` field mandatory | Description of operation result |
| Success responses return meaningful payloads | E.g., generated document text, embeddings |
| Error responses must return clear errors | Standardized error handling |

---

# 🧩 Versioning Guidelines

| Rule | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| Use versioned URLs | `/v1/` for current endpoints |
| Introduce `/v2/` only for breaking changes | Maintain backward compatibility where possible |
| Document version history in changelogs | Future-proof the platform |

---

# 🛑 Error Handling Guidelines

| Rule | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| HTTP 200 for logical success/failure inside payload | Only use 4xx/5xx for infrastructure errors |
| Logical errors reflected via `"status": "error"` inside JSON |
| Error payload includes `message` | Explain why request failed |
| No leaking internal stack traces | Clean, user-facing errors only |

---

# 🏷️ Metadata Best Practices

| Rule | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| Always store core metadata with documents/chunks | project_name, document_type, file_id, etc. |
| Enrich metadata during intake and enhancement | Never overwrite original source metadata |
| Allow metadata-based filtering at retrieval | For more powerful search capabilities |

---

# 🔒 Security Considerations

| Rule | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| Input validation at every service | Prevent injection or payload tampering |
| No sensitive data exposed in responses | Keep payloads clean |
| Authentication/Authorization can be added later | Prepare for future multi-user support |
