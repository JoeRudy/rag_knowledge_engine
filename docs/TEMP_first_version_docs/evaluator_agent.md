# Component Deep Dive - Evaluator Agent

## Component Name
Evaluator Agent

## Primary Responsibility
Validate drafted documents against predefined templates, content rules, and quality standards to ensure completeness, clarity, and traceability.

## Inputs
- Drafted documents (from the Author Agent)
- Document template (predefined structure and section requirements)

## Outputs
- Structured evaluation report listing detected issues, severity levels, affected sections, and suggested improvements
- Flags for the Enhancer Agent to automatically attempt fixes on detected issues

## Subcomponents/Modules
- **Structure Validator**: Checks compliance with the document template (presence and correct ordering of sections)
- **Content Quality Validator**: Assesses clarity, coherence, and presence of traceable source references in sections
- **Severity Assigner**: Classifies detected issues as Critical, Warning, or Info based on impact
- **Evaluation Reporter**: Generates a structured report for each evaluated document

## Dependencies
- Author Agent outputs (drafted documents)
- Document templates and section validation rules

## Special Behavior
- **Structural Validation**: Ensures all required sections exist and are properly populated
- **Content Quality Validation**: Ensures sections have reasonable clarity and are supported by traceable sources
- **Flagging for Enhancement**: Identifies issues that the Enhancer Agent can attempt to fix
- **Severity Levels**: Categorizes issues into Critical, Warning, and Info
- **Structured Evaluation Report**: Maintains a report summarizing all findings per document

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate scoring/ranking system for overall document quality
- Add learning-based evaluation (dynamic standards evolution based on human feedback)
- Cross-check consistency across multiple sections (e.g., intro vs detailed design)
- Support different evaluation modes (strict validation vs advisory review)
