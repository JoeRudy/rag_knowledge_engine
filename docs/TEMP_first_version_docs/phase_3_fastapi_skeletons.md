# Phase 3: FastAPI Skeletons - Detailed Steps

This document captures all detailed instructions for creating and configuring minimal FastAPI applications for each microservice in the RAG Knowledge Engine.

---

# 🔢 Overview

Each service will have its own clean, minimal FastAPI app to:
- Expose a health check endpoint (`/health`)
- Serve as the foundation for future route expansion
- Enable easy container health monitoring later (e.g., Kubernetes probes)

Minimal apps keep containers small, fast, and production-ready.

# 💡 Key Concepts

| Concept | Meaning |
|:--------|:--------|
| FastAPI | Lightweight, high-performance Python API framework |
| `app.py` | Entry point for each agent service |
| `/health` endpoint | Always-available endpoint to check if service is alive |

---

# 📈 Professional Best Practices Being Followed

| Practice | Why Important |
|:---------|:--------------|
| One `app.py` per service | Keeps microservices independent |
| Include `/health` endpoint | Enables clean container health checks |
| Minimal initial app structure | Fast boot, low memory footprint |
| Future-proof routing design | Easy to add new routes modularly |

---

# 👁️ Minimal FastAPI `app.py` Template

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/health")
def health_check():
    return {"status": "ok"}
```

✅ Every agent service will start with this base structure.

✅ Each `uvicorn` server will run this app inside its container.

# 📋 Phase 3 Task Checklist

| Step | Action | Status |
|:-----|:-------|:-------|
| 3.1 | Create `app.py` for Intake Agent | ✅ Completed |
| 3.2 | Create `app.py` for Embedding Service | ✅ Completed |
| 3.3 | Create `app.py` for Retriever Service | ✅ Completed |
| 3.4 | Create `app.py` for Author Agent | ✅ Completed |
| 3.5 | Create `app.py` for Evaluator Agent | ✅ Completed |
| 3.6 | Create `app.py` for Enhancer Agent | ✅ Completed |

✅ Each service has its own fully isolated FastAPI skeleton app.

✅ Future expansion (like adding `/embed`, `/retrieve`, `/evaluate`, etc.) will extend these base apps cleanly.
