# Component Deep Dive - Human Review Layer

## Component Name
Human Review Layer

## Primary Responsibility
Ensure human validation and final approval of auto-generated and auto-enhanced documents, especially focusing on documents with Critical issues.

## Inputs
- Enhanced documents (from Enhancer Agent)
- Structured evaluation reports (from Evaluator Agent)

## Outputs
- Approved documents ready for delivery or publishing
- Feedback reports (Request Enhancement or Rejection) for documents needing additional work

## Subcomponents/Modules
- **Critical Issue Review Handler**: Always reviews documents that had Critical issues flagged
- **Optional Sampling Review Handler**: Randomly samples or user-requested review of clean documents
- **Reviewer Action Interface**: Allows human reviewers to Approve, Request Enhancement, or Reject documents
- **Feedback Generator**: Captures feedback for Enhancer Agent or Author Agent if further action is needed

## Dependencies
- Evaluator Agent outputs (evaluation reports)
- Enhancer Agent outputs (enhanced documents)
- Sampling configuration (e.g., 5â€“10% of clean documents)

## Special Behavior
- **Mandatory Review for Critical Issues**: Critical-flagged documents must be human-reviewed even if auto-fixed
- **Optional Review for Clean Documents**: Random sampling and user-request options supported
- **Structured Human Actions**: Approve, Request Enhancement, or Reject decisions recorded for each reviewed document

## Future Enhancements
- Human review feedback loop to continuously improve AI agents based on reviewer decisions
- Multi-reviewer workflows (two-pass reviews or peer verification)
- Priority escalation for time-sensitive or high-importance documents
- Dashboard and analytics for tracking review rates and outcomes
