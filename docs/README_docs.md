# README_docs.md

# 📚 Documentation Overview

Welcome to the **RAG Knowledge Engine** documentation.

This `/docs/` folder is organized into clean subfolders to make it easier to find system design documents, agent specifications, API schemas, and deployment instructions as the project scales.

# 🗂️ Folder Structure

| Folder | Purpose |
|:-------|:--------|
| `00_foundation/` | Core project-wide foundational documents: system setup, architecture diagram, checklist, ownership definitions. |
| `01_problem_definition/` | Problem statement, high-level component designs, early-stage system purpose documents. |
| `02_agents_specs/` | Detailed deep dives for every individual agent and service (e.g., Intake Agent, Author Agent, etc.). |
| `03_api_design/` | API schemas, payload formats, and API best practices used across services. |
| `04_deployment/` | Docker Compose setup and deployment-related documentation. |

# 📢 Important Notes

- **No files renamed**: All file names exactly match the ones approved during original design.
- **No content changed**: All files retain their intended purpose.
- **Scalable**: New design phases or modules can easily add folders (e.g., `/05_monitoring/`, `/06_versioning/`, etc.)

# ✅ Navigation Best Practices

- System-wide concepts → go to `00_foundation/`
- Problem definition or design thinking → `01_problem_definition/`
- Specific agent behavior → `02_agents_specs/`
- API-level design and contracts → `03_api_design/`
- Deployment instructions → `04_deployment/`

# 🛠️ Update Process

Whenever adding a new document:
1. Place it in the correct subfolder.
2. Update this `README_docs.md` with a link and description.
3. Maintain consistent naming: **lowercase_with_underscores.md**

# 🔥 Designed for Precision

This structure ensures:
- Clean engineering onboarding
- Easy scaling
- Fast lookup for design reviews
- Professional-quality documentation management
