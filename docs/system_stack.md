# üåê High-Level System Overview

- **Deployment Mode**: Fully Local (Azure VM)
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose
- **External Services**: None (except outbound API calls to LLM providers if needed)
- **Vector Storage**: Supabase (Postgres + pgvector extension)
- **Microservices**: Python-based FastAPI apps

# üèõÔ∏è Why PostgreSQL + pgvector Extension

PostgreSQL with the `pgvector` extension was chosen for the following reasons:

- **Structured Metadata Support**: PostgreSQL allows strict schema enforcement for metadata (e.g., document title, version, project name).
- **Unified Storage**: Vectors and rich metadata can be stored in the same database, enabling seamless hybrid search (semantic + metadata filtering).
- **Robust Querying**: Complex queries using SQL can be executed easily, enabling advanced filtering, joins, and aggregations.
- **Local Deployment**: Supabase provides a fully self-hosted option for PostgreSQL and pgvector, fitting the project's local-only deployment requirement.
- **Scalability and Reliability**: PostgreSQL is a mature, production-grade database, ensuring future growth and reliability.
- **Open Source**: No vendor lock-in; ability to customize or extend as needed.
- **Ease of Dockerization**: PostgreSQL and Supabase are easily containerized for development and production use.

‚úÖ This makes PostgreSQL + pgvector the best choice for combining vector search with structured, enforceable metadata at scale.

# üîê Enforced Metadata Fields and Project Fit

The system enforces metadata fields for every uploaded document to guarantee structured retrieval, auditing, and validation. The enforced metadata fields include:

- **Document Title**
- **Project Name**
- **Document Type** (e.g., SRS, Design Document, Meeting Notes)
- **Version**
- **Uploaded By (Author/User)**
- **Upload Timestamp**

## Why Enforced Metadata Matters

- **Improved Searchability**: Allows Retriever Service to apply precise filtering based on project name, document type, or version.
- **Traceability**: Enables full audit trails of document origin and revision history.
- **Human Review**: Ensures human reviewers know document context instantly.
- **Multi-Document Support**: Supports generating complex documents pulling from multiple sources tagged by project and document type.

## Why This Project Requires It

- **Complex Workflows**: Documents evolve through multiple AI agents and human reviews; reliable metadata ensures consistency.
- **Multi-Source Inputs**: The system handles various input types (audio, text, pdf, source code) ‚Äî structured metadata unifies these formats.
- **Regulatory and Documentation Standards**: Technical documentation often needs strict versioning, authorship, and project tagging for compliance.
- **Future Growth**: Supports expanding into advanced analytics like document evolution tracking, user activity logs, and project dashboards.

‚úÖ Strict metadata enforcement is essential to maintain system reliability, transparency, and scalability as the project expands.

# üìä System Communication Flow

- User uploads file to Intake Agent.
- Intake Agent extracts text, chunks it, and passes it to Embedding Service.
- Embedding Service stores embeddings + metadata into Supabase.
- Retriever Service pulls matching chunks based on query + metadata constraints.
- Author Agent drafts the document.
- Evaluator Agent checks the document.
- Enhancer Agent improves if needed.
- Human Reviewer reviews and approves/finalizes the document.

---

# üìÜ Deployment Notes

- All services are Docker containers launched via `docker compose up --build`.
- Shared local volumes are used for logs, uploads, and temporary storage.
- Ports are mapped and exposed on localhost for development.
- Environment variables are passed via `.env` and referenced in `docker-compose.yml`.
- Outbound API calls (e.g., OpenAI) are made securely from inside containers.
