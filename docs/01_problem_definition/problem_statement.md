# ðŸ“š Problem Statement

This document defines the official problem statement that the RAG Knowledge Engine project addresses. It serves as the core "north star" to maintain project focus during all future phases.

# ðŸ“‹ Problem Definition

Data and software engineering teams often need to generate highly structured technical documentation as part of building software systems.

The traditional documentation process is:
- Manual
- Error-prone
- Inconsistent
- Highly dependent on a few key individuals

Key challenges include:
- Engineers forgetting to document key decisions made during meetings.
- Disconnected information scattered across emails, audio recordings, codebases, and spreadsheets.
- Difficulty maintaining a "single source of truth" that accurately reflects the evolving system design.

This lack of structured documentation slows down:
- Development velocity
- Onboarding of new engineers
- Cross-team collaboration
- System maintainability over time

# ðŸ“‹ Project Purpose

The RAG Knowledge Engine aims to solve this by:
- Intaking all available information sources (meetings, documents, spreadsheets, source code).
- Structuring and transforming raw knowledge into standardized technical documents.
- Applying Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to ground generated documentation in real, verifiable facts.
- Providing AI-based document validation, enhancement, and human review support.
- Ensuring documentation always evolves in lockstep with the actual system.

# ðŸ“‹ Target Users

- **Primary**: Data Engineers
- **Secondary**: Software Engineers, Architects, Technical Project Managers

The initial system will focus on data engineering-specific software systems, but the architecture is extensible to broader engineering domains.

# ðŸ“‹ Scope and Boundaries

âœ… Generate initial draft documents:
- Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
- Architecture Design Documents
- System Overview Documents

âœ… Support diverse input sources:
- Audio transcripts
- Meeting notes
- PDFs
- Word documents
- Excel/CSV files
- Source code snippets

âœ… Allow human review, approval, and enhancements

âœ… Focus on local, self-contained deployment (no external cloud dependencies)

---

# ðŸ“‹ Out of Scope

- Multi-language support (only English supported initially)
- Real-time live meeting capture (post-MVP feature)
- Cloud-native hosting (local deployment only at MVP)
- Multi-user authentication and access control (future phases)

---

# ðŸ“¢ Important Notes

- The problem scope should be reviewed and revalidated after major system milestones.
- Expansion to support broader documentation types (e.g., test plans, runbooks) is anticipated in later phases.
